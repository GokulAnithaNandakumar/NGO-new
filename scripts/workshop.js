                                                <li>The story of PRA Health Sciences would naturally talk about how weâ€™ve become one of the worldâ€™s largest CROs. It would talk about our innovation and growth and would speak to our operational efficiencies and transparency. It would highlight our expertise and customization. And it would touch on the incredible differences weâ€™ve made, over our more than 30years, in helping to bring to market everything from niche treatments and therapies to blockbuster drugs. More than anything else, our story would be about people. Not only our over 10,000 employees operating in more than 80 countries, though theyâ€™d certainly be a big part of it, but also the people that inspire them. The heroes of any PRA Health Sciences story are the clients we serve and the people whose lives we help improve, all over the world. And our story has only just begun.
